# NgIntervalCycles

## Introduction

NgIntervalCycles is a web application used to explore equal temperaments in the context of music. It uses the browser's AudioContext as a synthesiser and allows for MIDI inputs.

## Deployment


The application can be deployed on GH pages with [angular-cli-ghpages
](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages). There is an [issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59341718/not-allowed-to-load-local-resource-error-on-chrome-angular-app-is-not-running) where angular-cli-ghpages will not work with Git Bash, so use another CLI such as CMD. Clone the repository, install the dependencies and run this command:

`ng deploy --base-href=/ng-interval-cycles/`

## MIDI Support

This application supports MIDI input devices (such as keyboards) which interact directly with the browser. This feature is currently only supported on Chrome. The following devices have been tested and are supported:
- M-Audio Keystation 49es
- Akai LPK25

# Components

## MatrixComponent

![MatrixComponent](/src/assets/matrix.jpg?raw=true)

The MatrixComponent displays the matrix of intervals generated by the selected temperament. Clicking a cell will play the selected note, and holding click will sustain the note. Selecting 'key' mode will show the keyboard key which can be pressed (and held) to play/sustain the note.

## CircleComponent

![CircleComponent](/src/assets/circle.jpg?raw=true)

The CircleComponent shows the relationship between the played notes in a radial pattern. It is similar to the circle of fifths (chord mode) or chromatic circle (radius mode) diagram.

## WaveformComponent

![WaveformComponent](/src/assets/waveform.jpg?raw=true)

The WaveformComponent shows the output of all the notes currently being played. Notice the interference between different notes, the amplitude in respect to volume, and the shape of the waveform selected ('sine', 'square', 'sawtooth', 'triangle').

## EnvelopeComponent

![EnvelopeComponent](/src/assets/envelope.jpg?raw=true)

The EnvelopeComponent allows for manipulation of how each note is played over time in an 'attack', 'decay', 'sustain', 'release' pattern. Click and drag the handles to change the contour of the envelope.
